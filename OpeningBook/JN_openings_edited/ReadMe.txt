The TCEC Superfinal openings (Season 9-17) from J.Noomen.

Edited by Stefan Pohl:
1) deleted all lines 4 plies or shorter
2) deleted all lines with non-unique endpositions
3) checked all endpositions with Komodo 13.02: 10'/move, Quadcore,
eval-interval [-0.50;+0.60]

293 out of 450 lines remaining. All endpositions are unique and
not too bad for white or black.

Forthcoming Superfinal seasons openings will be added in the future.

293 lines: TCEC_9_17_edited.pgn (and EPD)
253 lines (enough for 500 games head-to-head of 2 engines) and no line is
longer than 10 moves: 
TCEC_9_17_10mvs.pgn (and EPD).


I edited J.Noomen's Gambit- and KingsIndian- opening sets, too:
1) deleted all lines with non-unique endpositions
2) checked all endpositions with Komodo 13.02: 10'/move, Quadcore,
eval-interval [-0.50;+0.60]
3) mixed the lines by the final digit of the gamenumber.

You find them in the 2 folders (JN_Gambit_openings_edited and
JN_Kingsindian_openings_edited).

Gambit contains 217 lines and KingsIndian contains 256 lines.

*****************************************************************************
I did a testrun of the 237 lines (=474 games) of the TCEC Superfinal 
openings (Season 9-15)

All games played with 5'+3'' (average game-duration: 15-16 minutes)
Singlecore, 256MB Hash, no endgame-bases, no ponder
both engines with Contempt=+15, LittleBlitzerGUI

Score is the result of asmFish 170426 - Komodo 10.4. Example: 
Score 60.3% – 39.7% means, that asmFish scored 60.3% and Komodo scored 39.7%

Here the results of some of my older testruns, which I did for the 
development of my SALC and Drawkiller openings:

Each testrun 1000 games: 
SF-Framework standard 8 move openings: Score 60.3% – 39.7%, draws: 63.4%
FEOBOS v20 contempt 5: Score 58.7% - 41.3%, draws: 64.1%
HERT 500: Score: 60.6% - 39.4%, draws: 60.4%
4 GM-moves short book: Score 60.5% - 39.5%, draws: 57.1%
SALC V5 full-closed 500 positions: Score 66.5% - 33.5%, draws: 47.7%
Drawkiller (small 500 positions set): Score: 66.4% - 33.6%, draws 30.5%

Here the result of the testrun of the TCEC Superfinal openings Season 9-15):
TCEC Superfinal openings (Season 9-15) edited (237 lines, 474 games): 
Score: 62.5% - 37.5%, draws: 50.4%

As you can see, the result is better, than the results of the other 
"classical" openings (SF-8moves, FEOBOS, HERT and 4 GM-moves). And
not so far away from the result of my SALC openings. Which is really
impressive. Of course, Drawkiller is out of reach and in its own
dimension...

*****************************************************************************
Here the results of the testruns with the (edited) Gambit-openings and the
KingsIndian-openings:

Gambit-openings (edited) (217 lines, 434 games):
Score: 60.1% - 39.9%, draws: 63.6%

KingsIndian-openings (edited) (256 lines, 512 games):
Score: 60.8% - 39.2%, draws: 57.6%

As you can see, the Gambit-openings give no better statistics than the classical
opening-sets (SF-Framework, FEOBOS) - little disappointing.
The KingsIndian openings statistics are on a level with the 4 GM-moves short
openings. 
Both are clearly worse, than the TCEC Superfinal openings by J.Noomen.
